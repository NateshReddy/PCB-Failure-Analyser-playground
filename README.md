# PCB-Failure-Analyser

## We have built a full PCB Failure Analyser that automates the task of detecting and classifying defects in PCB which will reduce human error percentage. The system is able to detect, extract and predict the type of defect in PCB. Comparatively analysed various model architectures on the DeepPCB dataset through transfer learning techniques.
